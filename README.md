## For developers

### Running tests

Start the test validator

```
yarn test:validator
```

Then while keeping the test validator running, run the following in another terminal

```
yarn test
```

To combine the above two steps and run the tests more easily, there's a helper script which can use by running the following

```
./run-tests.sh
```
